# Graph Matching Project
This project implements and evaluates algorithms for graph matching, including:
- Greedy Matching
- Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm
- Edmond's Blossom Algorithm

## Key Results
- Runtime comparisons across random, bipartite, and complete graphs.
- Approximation ratio analysis for Greedy Matching.

## Files
- `project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
- `project.html`: HTML export of the notebook for easy viewing.
